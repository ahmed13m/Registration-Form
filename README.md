There are many great registration form's available, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a Regestration Form so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
<ol>
<li>It is way more responsive and interactive</li>
  <li>With simple & bright Design</li>
  <li>Haha, I was Just Kidding ðŸ˜„</li></ol>
Of course, this is may not be the best I will try improving it. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have have contributed to expanding this template!
